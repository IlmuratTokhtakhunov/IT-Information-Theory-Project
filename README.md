# IT-Information-Theory-Project
<h3>This project was created for Information Theory course and implements all aspects of this course in Python and Java</h3>
<p>Made by Tokhtakhunov Il'murat 3 course student of IT University(Almaty), specialty: CSSE</p>
<p>This project directed to create of binary coding which will be optimal and reliable against noise during transmission</p>
<p>Project Implements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Huffman algorithm(Python version)</li>
  <li>Shannon-Fano algorithm(Java version)</li>
  <li>Algorithm for detecting and fixing mistakes appeared furing transmission(used syndrome technic)</li>
</ol>
